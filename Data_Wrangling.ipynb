The value passed to the **Season** parameter is the last 2 numbers in the second part of the season identifier.  So to access swim meets from Nov 2019, the season parameter will be 20 ('season'='20')\n",
    "* Month - the month must be specified as a number from 1 to 12.  It is not possible to have all the months in a single season being available at one time\n",
    "* Province - It is possible to filter by province/territory or use all provinces. To access an individual province/territory, the provinces/territories are numbered from 1 to 11 in alphabetical order.  So to get only Alberta, 'province'='1' and to get Yukon, 'province'='11'.  The supported Territories are Northwest Territories and Yukon.  For all provinces, no number is provided to province (province = '')\n",
